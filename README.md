# SmartyStreets Java SDK

The official client libraries for accessing SmartyStreets APIs from Java (and JRE-based languages)

You may have noticed this page is curiously sparse. Don't panic, there's [documentation](https://smartystreets.com/docs/sdk/java) and [examples](src/main/java/examples).

When using this library in an Android project, be sure to exclude commons-logging and httpclient as they will conflict with classes provided by Android.

If you use an embedded key on the server-side (for US Autocomplete Pro for example), 
you should whitelist your server IP and use `EmbeddedKeyCredentials` instead of `SharedCredentials`.
